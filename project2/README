I had a non-flat folder structure, so the Makefile is written for that, idk how handin handles folders.
root
-Makefile
-README
-src (directory)
--lwp.c
--magic64.S
-include (directory)
--lwp.h
--fp.h
-build (directory)

Running make in root will outputs liblwp.so in the build directory. I can't submit directories, so you might need to mkdir it?
